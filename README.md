# Microsoft DebugView PowerShell Wrapper âš¡

This tool acts as a wrapper for the [Microsoft Sysinternals DebugView](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/debugview) software.

The main ideas is to provide better debugging for IIS based applications (w3wp), while also providing better direct CLI handling for just checking simple logging.

While the existing DebugView has fitlers - I don't want to be clicking around and changing things manually constantly when a PID changes.

## Features

- **Auto-handling process-name PIDs for filtering**  
- **Easy install/uninstall and `PATH` handling**  
- **`System.Diagnostics.Debug()` Support for ASP .NET IIS Applications**  
- **Generic filtering for anything else available**

## Usage

### Installation

```PowerShell
git clone https://github.com/umutguler/ms-iis-debugview-wrapper
cd ms-iis-debugview-wrapper
.\Start-DebugView.ps1 -Install
# Restart your Terminal Session as it adds to your PATH
```

> [!NOTE]
The script downloads the ZIP directly from Microsoft's URL each time you install.

### Uninstall

Removes the folder created in `%APPDATA%` and your user's `PATH`

```PowerShell
.\Start-DebugView.ps1 -Uninstall
# Restart your Terminal Session as it adds to your PATH
```

### Example Usages

- Start without filter

```PowerShell
.\Start-DebugView.ps1
```

- Start without with generic filter

This filters based on whatever it would output per log line. Including PID as it's already part of the log.

```PowerShell
.\Start-DebugView.ps1 -Filter "1234"
```

- Start without with Profile filter.

Only supported profile is IIS currently.

```PowerShell
.\Start-DebugView.ps1 -FilterProfile IIS
```

- Start without with Process Name filter.

This finds all processes based on that name and captures all the logs related to those PIDs.

```PowerShell
.\Start-DebugView.ps1 -ProcessName "exampleprocess"
```
